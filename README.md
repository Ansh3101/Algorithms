## 📘 Introduction

Welcome to the **Algorithms** repository! This repository is structured to help you build a strong foundation in programming, starting from basic C++ syntax and moving towards more complex algorithms and data structures. By the end of this journey, you'll have a solid understanding of how to approach problems programmatically and efficiently.

## 💻 Basic C++ Programming

In this section, you will find fundamental C++ programs that cover basic concepts such as variables, data types, loops, functions, and classes. These building blocks will prepare you for more complex programming tasks.

- **Variables and Data Types:** Understand the different types of variables in C++ and how to use them.
- **Control Structures:** Learn about loops (`for`, `while`) and conditional statements (`if`, `switch`) to control the flow of your programs.
- **Functions and Recursion:** Delve into writing reusable code blocks and exploring recursive functions.
- **Classes and Objects:** Get introduced to object-oriented programming with classes and objects in C++.

## 🔢 Pattern Writing Algorithms

Pattern writing is a crucial step in learning programming. It enhances logical thinking and provides a better understanding of loops and conditional statements.

- **Star Patterns:** Learn how to create various star patterns using nested loops.
- **Number Patterns:** Explore number sequences and their visual representation through programming.
- **Alphabet Patterns:** Understand how to manipulate characters and strings to form alphabetic patterns.

## 📊 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

### Data Structures

#### 🔢 1. Array/List
- **What it is:** An array is like a row of boxes, where each box holds a single item. The items are stored one after another in a fixed order. A list (like a `vector` in C++) is similar but more flexible—it can grow or shrink in size as you add or remove items.
- **Real-life analogy:** Think of an array like a row of lockers. You can store one item in each locker, and you can quickly access any item by knowing its locker number.
- **When to use:** When you need to store a fixed number of items and want quick access to any of them by their position.

#### 🔗 2. Linked List
- **What it is:** A linked list is a series of connected nodes, where each node contains an item and a reference (or "link") to the next node. Unlike an array, the items in a linked list don't have to be next to each other in memory.
- **Real-life analogy:** Imagine a treasure hunt where each clue leads you to the next one. The clues (nodes) are linked together, and you follow the trail to find the treasure (last node).
- **When to use:** When you need to insert or delete items frequently, especially at the beginning or end of the list.

#### 📚 3. Stack/Queue

##### 🗂️ Stack:
- **What it is:** A stack is a collection of items that follows the "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates—you always take the top plate off first.
- **When to use:** When you need to keep track of things in a specific order and only care about the most recent item (like undo actions in a program).

##### 🎫 Queue:
- **What it is:** A queue is a collection of items that follows the "First In, First Out" (FIFO) principle. It's like a line of people waiting to buy tickets—the first person in line gets served first.
- **When to use:** When you need to process items in the order they arrive (like tasks in a printer queue).

#### 🔑 4. Hash Table
- **What it is:** A hash table is like a super-fast lookup system. You store items using a unique key, and when you want to find something, the key helps you jump directly to it. It's like a magical filing system where each key instantly leads you to the correct file.
- **Real-life analogy:** Think of a hash table as a library's book index, where you can quickly find a book using its title or author as the key.
- **When to use:** When you need to store and retrieve items quickly using unique identifiers, like a dictionary.

#### 🌐 5. Graph
- **What it is:** A graph is a way to represent relationships between different things. It consists of nodes (things) connected by edges (relationships). Graphs can represent anything from social networks to maps and even computer networks.
- **Real-life analogy:** Imagine a map where cities are connected by roads. The cities are nodes, and the roads are edges connecting them.
- **When to use:** When you need to model relationships or connections between items, like finding the shortest path between two points on a map.

### Algorithms

#### 🔍 1. Linear Search
- **What it is:** Linear search is the simplest way to find an item in a list. You start at the beginning and check each item one by one until you find what you're looking for.
- **Real-life analogy:** It's like searching for a specific book in an unsorted stack of books—you look through each book until you find the one you want.
- **When to use:** When you have a small list or when the items are not in any particular order.

#### 📖 2. Binary Search
- **What it is:** Binary search is a fast way to find an item in a sorted list. Instead of checking every item, you repeatedly divide the list in half and decide whether to continue searching in the left half or the right half.
- **Real-life analogy:** It's like searching for a word in a dictionary by flipping to the middle page and deciding if you need to look on the left or right side.
- **When to use:** When you have a large, sorted list and need to find items quickly.

#### 🃏 3. Bubble Sort
- **What it is:** Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
- **Real-life analogy:** Imagine sorting a deck of cards by repeatedly looking at pairs of cards and swapping them if they are out of order.
- **When to use:** When you need to sort a small list and want a simple algorithm to understand.

#### 🔀 4. Merge Sort
- **What it is:** Merge sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together in the correct order.
- **Real-life analogy:** Imagine you have several small stacks of sorted cards, and you merge them into one large, sorted stack by combining them one at a time.
- **When to use:** When you need to sort large lists efficiently.

#### 🌳 5. Graph Algorithms (DFS and BFS)

##### 🕳️ DFS (Depth-First Search):
- **What it is:** DFS is a way to explore all the nodes in a graph by going as deep as possible down one path before backtracking and exploring other paths.
- **Real-life analogy:** It's like exploring a maze by always taking the next possible turn until you hit a dead end, then backtracking to find another route.
- **When to use:** When you want to explore all possible paths from a starting point in a graph.

##### 🔄 BFS (Breadth-First Search):
- **What it is:** BFS explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It’s like exploring layer by layer.
- **Real-life analogy:** It's like exploring a maze level by level, making sure you've checked everything at one distance before moving further.
- **When to use:** When you need to find the shortest path in a graph or explore all possible connections starting from a given node.
